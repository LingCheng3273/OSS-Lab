## 3. Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?
It is important to choose a license so that users can clearly know their rights. Free and open source software licenses list a set of rights that all users have, so users understand what they can and cannot do with the software. Ultimately they protect the right of the user to use and modify a software however they wish to. 

## 4. Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
You shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license because it is unclear what you're allowed to do with the project. The owner of the project might require the user to use the software for specific purposes or not allow any modifications. Since your rights aren't clear, you can't assume that you can do whatever you want to the software.

## 5. Why the Web beat Gopher
I agree with the common argument that Gopher's demise is that it does not support hypertext. Hypertext makes navigation through links more intuitive and useful to the public. Without hypertext, Gopher restricts its use to people who are more knowledgeable about how to use the internet.

## 6. Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosoophy of the project 
Linux uses the GPL v2 license because the GNU Project was started around the time and the GPU had already been written. Libraries were written for most of programs necessary in an operating system. Linus Torvalds then used the existing open source libraries to write the Linux kernel.
