## Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?
It is important to choose a license so that users can clearly know their rights. Free and open source software licenses list a set of rights that all users have, so users understand what they can and cannot do with the software. Ultimately they protect the right of the user to use and modify a software however they wish to.
