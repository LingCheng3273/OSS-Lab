## 3. Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?
It is important to choose a license so that users can clearly know their rights. Free and open source software licenses list a set of rights that all users have, so users understand what they can and cannot do with the software. Ultimately they protect the right of the user to use and modify a software however they wish to. 

## 4. Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
You shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license because it is unclear what you're allowed to do with the project. The owner of the project might require the user to use the software for specific purposes or not allow any modifications. Since your rights aren't clear, you can't assume that you can do whatever you want to the software.
