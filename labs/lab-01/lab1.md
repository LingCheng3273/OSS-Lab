### Free Culture Chapter 3
  The chapter showed the important of open source softwares. Jesse improved an existing search engine for the benefit of everyone, 
  but his modifications were not welcomed. He was branded a pirate and claimed to violate copyright laws. Jesse didn't do anything 
  inherently wrong to deserve such treatment. Such copyright laws would prevent anyone to potentially improve existing technology. 
  If the search engine was an open source software, then any improvements to the programs would have been well received. Open source 
  softwares encourage such modifications for the better experience of everyone using the software. In addition, people with great ideas 
  like Jesse won't have to worry about legal issues when acting upon their ideas.
